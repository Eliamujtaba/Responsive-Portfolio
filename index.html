        <br> My Name is Mujtaba Elia. It is twoo years i am imagrated from Afghanistan to the 
        <br> United States I got my bachelor degree in cinema at Kabul University,
        <br> Fine Art Faculty. When i moved to the US,
        <br> i found out that it is to hard to work in cinema feild in the Unite States. 
        <br> That requires alot of money. After film directory,
        <br>  i always had intrest in computer science. First i started learning ESL
        <br> in ARC comunity college. I found out that if i continue in ARC, it will take more than 5 years to
        <br> get my bachelor degree in computer science. Because i need to learn English language first an than
        <br> i can start my major. I was looking for a short tearm course which can teach me programing. Finally
        <br> i found UC Davis Extension Boot Camps. I started learning programing in US Davis Extension to reach
        <br> my goal and I wish to find a good job after I graduated.I found out that if
